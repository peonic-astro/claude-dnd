# DM Story Prep - Tamwin Badgerfoot Campaign

## The Strange Tingling (Core Mystery)

### What It Really Is
The "tingling" is not supernatural---it's **restlessness**. A deep, existential itch born from spending three years watching the same gate, walking the same streets, breaking up the same tavern fights in Burlap. Tamwin has convinced himself it's a sign, a calling, but it's actually the suffocating realization that he's wasting his life in a town where nothing ever happens.

The truth is darker: **there is no destiny**. The world doesn't care about Tamwin. He's one small halfling in a brutal, indifferent world. The tingling will fade once he faces real danger---replaced by fear, exhaustion, and the cold clarity that adventure isn't heroic, it's survival.

### Narrative Use
- Early on, Tamwin can interpret the tingling as guidance or intuition
- Let him feel "drawn" to opportunities---but never confirm it's real
- When he faces true horror (death, betrayal, moral compromise), the tingling stops
- If player asks about it later: "You realize you haven't felt it in days. Maybe you never needed it."

### The Real Hook
Tamwin left because he was **bored and afraid of dying ordinary**. That's human. That's real. The question is: will the world break him, or will he carve out something worth the cost?

## BRACKFORD NPCs

### Captain Darrow
**Role:** Watch Captain, Brackford
**Loyalty:** 3/10 (Professional interest, not personal)
**Commitment:** Will provide work if Tamwin proves reliable; not a friend
**Personality:** Efficient, overworked, no-nonsense, values results
**Hidden Agenda:** NONE. Darrow is exactly what he appears: a competent, tired lawman.
**Key Facts:**
- Genuinely struggling with the bandit problem (Watch is a town guard, not a field army)
- Has ~30 watchmen for a town of 2,000; can't spare men for road patrols
- Reports to the town council, who are pressuring him about merchant complaints
- Respects Tamwin's initiative but will test him with smaller jobs first
- Knows Marcus Grey well (Grey Stag is where Watch drinks off duty)
- **Will offer Tamwin work:** See "Adventure Hooks" section below

### Mr. Brenner (Aldous Brenner)
**Role:** Merchant, Brenner & Sons
**Loyalty:** 4/10 (Grateful, but grief-focused)
**Commitment:** Would pay well for news of Petyr; willing to fund rescue
**Personality:** Controlled, practical, hides fear behind professionalism
**Hidden Agenda:** NONE. A father terrified for his son. What you see is what you get.
**Key Facts:**
- Runs mid-sized haulage business (3 wagons, 6 employees)
- Petyr is his youngest (age 19), eager but inexperienced
- Sent Petyr on the east road run because the older drivers refused (too dangerous)
- Blames himself for sending the boy
- Wife (Sira Brenner) is barely holding together
- Would pay significant reward (50-100 gp) for Petyr's safe return
- Would pay smaller amount (20 gp) for confirmed news, even if bad
- Has a second son (Edric, 25) who runs the warehouse; steady, cautious, resents Petyr's recklessness

### Mrs. Brenner (Sira Brenner)
**Role:** Merchant's wife
**Loyalty:** 3/10 (Grateful but consumed by grief)
**Commitment:** Emotional, would beg Tamwin to find Petyr
**Personality:** Warm normally, currently fragile and desperate
**Hidden Agenda:** NONE.
**Key Facts:**
- Keeps the household and books for Brenner & Sons
- Recognized the family token Tamwin brought immediately
- Barely keeping composure; cried when token was delivered
- Will approach Tamwin privately if she sees him again to plead for help finding Petyr

### Marcus Grey
**Role:** Innkeeper, Grey Stag inn
**Loyalty:** N/A (not yet met; will start at 2/10 - polite but reserved)
**Commitment:** Will honor Wellan's letter with a fair room rate and maybe a job lead
**Personality:** Shrewd, observant, good host, careful with trust, dry humor
**HIDDEN AGENDA: YES**
**Secret:** Marcus Grey runs a quiet information-brokering side business. He doesn't spy himself but collects gossip, news, and intelligence from traveling merchants and sells it to interested parties---other merchants, the Watch (Darrow is a regular buyer), and occasionally less savory clients. He's not evil, not a criminal exactly, but he profits from knowing things others don't. His inn is his listening post.
- **Implication for Tamwin:** Marcus will be very interested in what Tamwin knows (bandit activity, road conditions, who's alive, who's dead). He'll offer hospitality and seem friendly, but he's always assessing what information is worth.
- **If discovered:** Would claim it's just "good business sense" and that everyone benefits from shared information. He's not wrong, exactly.
- **Danger level:** Low. Marcus is not hostile. But information Tamwin shares with him may reach ears Tamwin didn't intend.
- **Wellan's relationship:** Wellan is one of Marcus's regular sources (merchants trade news naturally). Wellan doesn't know about the brokering side---he just thinks Marcus is a well-connected friend.

### Lyra Thorne
**Role:** Apothecary, herbalist
**Loyalty:** N/A (not yet met; will start at 2/10 - professional)
**Commitment:** Will sell supplies, provide healing advice, may offer work
**Personality:** Precise, bookish, quiet intensity, doesn't suffer fools, respects competence and knowledge

**Key Facts:**
- Mid-30s, dark hair usually pinned up, ink-stained fingers, spectacles
- Trained as an apprentice in a larger city before settling in Brackford
- Knows Elda Farrow from herb trade (they correspond by letter; mutual respect)

- **Practical resource:** Can identify unknown substances, poisons, herbs for Tamwin

### Brother Aldous
**Role:** Cleric, Temple of the Three
**Loyalty:** N/A (not yet met)
**Commitment:** Provides healing for donation, counsel for free
**Personality:** Patient, kind, overworked, slightly absent-minded
**Hidden Agenda:** NONE.
**Key Facts:**
- Only cleric in Brackford; handles births, deaths, marriages, healing
- Can cast Cure Wounds, Lesser Restoration (for reasonable donations)
- Hears confession-like conversations; knows many secrets but keeps them
- Worried about the bandit situation and its toll on families

### Edric Brenner
**Role:** Aldous Brenner's elder son, warehouse manager
**Loyalty:** N/A (not yet met)
**Commitment:** Skeptical of outsiders; protective of family business
**Personality:** Cautious, bitter about Petyr, resentful of his father's favoritism
**Hidden Agenda:** NONE, but emotionally complex.
**Key Facts:**
- Age 25, does the reliable boring work while Petyr got the "exciting" runs
- Thinks Petyr was reckless and stupid to take the east road
- Loves his brother but resents him; guilty about feeling angry
- If Tamwin meets him, Edric will be colder and more suspicious than the parents
- Could provide practical help (maps of routes, wagon schedules, who trades what)

## THE PETYR BRENNER SITUATION (Major Plot Thread)

### What Actually Happened
Petyr Brenner (age 19) was driving a grain wagon east on King's Road, heading to Greenhollow. About 8 miles east of Brackford, near the dense woods past Harrow's Bridge, the wagon was ambushed by a bandit gang.

### Is Petyr Alive?
**YES, for now.** Petyr is alive but captive.

### The Full Story
The King's Road bandits are not random thugs. They're a small, organized gang of **6-8 members** led by a man called **Garrett "The Crow" Voss**---a former mercenary who deserted his company after a campaign went bad. His gang has been growing bolder:

- **Month 1:** Hit a lone peddler (robbed, let go)
- **Month 2:** Hit a merchant wagon (robbed, driver beaten, let go)
- **Month 3 (recent):** Hit Brenner wagon (robbed, took Petyr captive)

The escalation is deliberate. Voss is building toward a bigger score: he wants to ransom Petyr back to the Brenner family for a significant sum. He knows Brenner & Sons has money. Petyr is alive because he's worth more alive.

### Petyr's Current Location
The gang operates from a **ruined forester's lodge** about 3 miles north of King's Road, deep in the Harrow Woods. It's an old stone foundation with a partial roof, surrounded by thick forest. Hard to find without tracking or intelligence.

### Petyr's Condition
- Alive, bound, bruised but not seriously injured
- Scared but trying to be brave (he's 19, this is his first real crisis)
- Being fed (barely) and kept under guard
- Voss keeps him tied in the cellar of the lodge
- One guard on Petyr at all times, others come and go

### The Bandits (King's Road Gang)

**Garrett "The Crow" Voss (Leader)** - CR 1 (use Bandit Captain stat block, adjusted)
- Former mercenary, mid-30s, lean, dark hair, crow tattoo on neck
- Smart, patient, not needlessly cruel but absolutely willing to kill
- Wears chain shirt, carries longsword and hand crossbow
- Has military training: uses sentries, escape routes, ambush tactics
- **Motivation:** Build enough wealth to disappear somewhere comfortable
- **Weakness:** Overconfident in his planning; doesn't expect serious opposition from a small town's Watch

**Gang Members (6-7 bandits)** - CR 1/8 each (use Bandit stat block)
- Mix of desperate farmers, petty criminals, and one ex-soldier
- Not all equally committed; some would flee or surrender if the fight goes badly
- Armed with short swords, clubs, shortbows
- Morale breaks if Voss goes down or if half the gang falls

**Notable Gang Members:**
- **Torvin:** Voss's second, ex-soldier, loyal, tough (use Thug stat block, CR 1/2). Scarred face, missing two fingers on left hand. Will fight to the death for Voss.
- **Nell:** Young woman, former farmhand, joined out of desperation. Least committed, most likely to flee or give information if caught. Has a blue scarf she tears strips from for bandages. **This is the source of the blue cloth scrap Tamwin found.**
- **Grady:** Big, slow, mean. Does what Voss says. Not bright. (Use Bandit stat block with +1 STR modifier.)

### Timeline If Tamwin Does Nothing
- **Day 7-8:** Voss sends a ransom note to Brenner family (50 gp demand, delivered by leaving it on the road for a passing traveler to find)
- **Day 10:** Darrow's patrol finds the ransacked wagon but no trail (they're Watch, not rangers)
- **Day 12:** Ransom note arrives. Brenners agonize.
- **Day 14:** If ransom not paid, Voss sends Petyr's ring finger as motivation
- **Day 18:** If still no payment, Voss kills Petyr and moves on to next territory
- **The gang continues operating regardless,** growing bolder each week

### Ways Tamwin Can Engage
1. **Direct rescue mission:** Track bandits from wagon site, find camp, assault or infiltrate
2. **Work with Darrow:** Join or lead Watch patrol, use Tamwin's tracking skills
3. **Intelligence gathering:** Ask around Brackford/Broken Wheel for bandit info
4. **Wait for ransom note:** Help Brenners negotiate or set trap at exchange
5. **Hire help:** Use coin to recruit fighters for assault
6. **Stealth approach:** Scout camp, free Petyr without fighting
7. **Combination:** Any mix of above

### Encounter Design for Bandit Camp
**Appropriate for Level 2 Fighter:**
- Full gang is HARD encounter (Voss CR 1 + Torvin CR 1/2 + 5 bandits CR 1/8)
- Smart approach: pick off sentries, free Petyr, fight reduced numbers
- Allies help: Darrow could send 2-3 watchmen; Edric might come
- Environmental advantages: approach at night, use fire, block escape routes
- **Key principle:** Reward preparation and planning. Charging in = likely death. Scouting, allies, and tactics = victory.

### The Blue Cloth Scrap
- Torn from Nell's blue scarf during the wagon ambush
- If Tamwin shows it around Brackford, nobody recognizes it specifically
- If Tamwin encounters Nell (at the camp, or if she's caught), he can match the scrap to her scarf
- This is a satisfying clue payoff, not a critical puzzle piece

## BRACKFORD ADVENTURE HOOKS

### Primary: The Petyr Brenner Rescue (See above)
**Difficulty:** Medium-Hard for Level 2 (requires planning, possibly allies)
**XP Reward:** 200-400 XP depending on approach (combat vs stealth vs negotiation)
**Gold Reward:** 50-100 gp from Brenners + whatever the bandits have
**Reputation:** Major boost in Brackford (saved a merchant's son)

### Secondary: Captain Darrow's Work Board
When Tamwin returns to the Watch House in a day or two, Darrow will have:

**1. Rat Problem in the Cellars (Easy)**
- Merchant guild's cellar storage has giant rat infestation
- 4-6 Giant Rats (CR 1/8 each) - straightforward pest control
- Pay: 5 gp from guild
- Good warm-up combat, earn a few coins, meet guild merchants
- XP: 50-75

**2. Caravan Escort to Greenhollow (Medium)**
- Merchant heading east needs armed escort (1-2 day round trip)
- Risk of bandit encounter on King's Road
- Pay: 15 gp for the round trip
- Could encounter Voss's gang or find more clues about them
- This is a natural way to combine "paid work" with "bandit investigation"
- XP: 100-200 depending on encounters

**3. Missing Watchman (Medium)**
- Watchman named Halric went on solo patrol two nights ago, hasn't returned
- Last seen heading toward the river docks area
- **Truth:** Halric got drunk at The Broken Wheel, got into a fight, is hiding at a friend's house with a broken nose, too embarrassed to report in
- Not dangerous but good investigation practice; introduces The Broken Wheel location
- Pay: 3 gp + Darrow's gratitude
- XP: 25-50 (social/investigation)

### Tertiary: Other Hooks Available in Brackford

**4. Lyra Thorne's Ingredient Request**
- After meeting Lyra, she may ask Tamwin to retrieve rare herbs from a dangerous location
- Could tie into exploring the Harrow Woods (where the bandits are)
- Pay: Potions of healing or antitoxin in trade
- Natural way to get Tamwin into the woods for multiple reasons

**5. The Broken Wheel Rumors**
- Spending an evening at the rough tavern yields gossip:
  - Someone's been buying a lot of rope and chain recently (Voss's gang, preparing for captives)
  - A woman matching Nell's description was seen buying supplies in town 3 days ago
  - Dock workers mention barge traffic being watched by someone in the woods north of river
- These are breadcrumbs toward the bandit camp

**6. Marcus Grey's "Favor"**
- After delivering Wellan's letter, if Tamwin impresses Grey:
- Grey might ask Tamwin to "keep his ears open" on the road and report interesting news
- Payment: Reduced room rates, free meals, occasional coin
- This is how Grey recruits information sources; Tamwin doesn't have to know it's brokering
- Could become morally interesting if Tamwin discovers Grey sells information

---

## DM Notes & Principles

### Tone Reminders
- **Dark but not hopeless.** Tamwin can make a difference, but it costs something.
- **NPCs are people, not quest givers.** They have fears, biases, and agendas.
- **Consequences persist.** Choices echo forward. A saved life, a burned cottage, a kept secret---these matter.

### Encounter Balance (Updated for Level 2)
- **Session 2 worked well:** CR 1/4 enemies (4 dogs) at Level 1 was challenging but fair
- Terrain and tactical options made the difference (cabin loft, doorway chokepoint)
- Player felt smart for using environment, not just lucky
- Continue this approach: provide tactical choices, not just dice rolls
- **For Level 2:** CR 1/4 to CR 1 enemies in small groups remain appropriate
- Single CR 2 is "hard," CR 3+ is deadly
- **Bandit camp encounter:** Reward scouting and preparation. Full frontal assault = very dangerous. Smart approach = winnable.

### Player Agency
- Don't railroad. If Tamwin ignores hooks, the world continues (Petyr timeline runs).
- If he tries unexpected solutions, roll with it and adjudicate fairly.
- The world responds to his actions but doesn't revolve around him.
- Let consequences develop naturally from choices.

### Mystery & Investigation Design
- Provide clear clues but don't hand-hold
- The blue cloth scrap should pay off satisfyingly
- Let player feel clever when they connect dots
- Investigation should feel rewarding, not like pixel-hunting

### Session 2/3 Lessons Learned

**What Worked:**
- Gradual investigation with multiple NPC interactions
- Clear tracking mechanics led to satisfying resolution
- Tactical combat with environmental features
- Reward distribution felt natural
- Player felt competent and capable
- Travel montage (Days 3-6) maintained atmosphere without dragging

**What to Continue:**
- Provide meaningful tactical choices in combat
- Let player negotiate and make social choices
- Track NPC reactions and relationships
- Allow generosity or pragmatism based on player preference
- Give environmental/social encounters alongside combat

**Notes for Future:**
- Brackford is a much larger stage than Millstone---more NPCs, more complexity
- Player has demonstrated: tactical thinking, fairness, competence, civic responsibility
- These traits should influence how Brackford NPCs react to Tamwin
- Word from Millstone hasn't reached Brackford yet (too soon, too far for foot traffic)
- Tamwin's reputation here is being built fresh from his actions in town

---

## Session 3 Remaining Checklist

Tamwin still needs to:
- [ ] Deliver Wellan's letter to Marcus Grey at Grey Stag inn
- [ ] Visit Lyra Thorne's apothecary (Elda's referral)
- [ ] Find lodging for the night
- [ ] Return to Watch House in a day or two for work from Darrow
- [ ] Decide what to do about Petyr Brenner situation

DM should be ready with:
- [ ] Marcus Grey's personality and information-broker angle
- [ ] Lyra Thorne's shop and personality
- [ ] Watch House work board (when Tamwin returns)
- [ ] Bandit camp details (if Tamwin pursues Petyr's rescue)
- [ ] Stat blocks: Giant Rat (CR 1/8), Bandit (CR 1/8), Bandit Captain (CR 2), Thug (CR 1/2)
- [ ] Brackford town map (mental model of key locations)

---

## Long-Term Story Arcs (To Develop Later)

### Arc 1: The Weight of Heroism (Levels 1-3)
- Tamwin takes on small problems (bandits, beasts, local threats).
- Theme: Heroism is hard, unglamorous work. Not everyone is grateful.
- Endpoint: Tamwin establishes a reputation (good or ill) and decides what kind of adventurer he wants to be.
- **Current progress:** Mid-arc. Tamwin has solved one crisis (Millstone) and is entering a second town with new problems. His choices in Brackford will further define his emerging identity.

### Arc 2: The Broken Kingdom (Levels 4-6)
- Larger threats emerge. Tamwin gets involved in regional politics.
- Theme: Power corrupts. Good intentions lead to terrible outcomes.
- Endpoint: Tamwin must choose a side in a conflict with no clear "good guys."
- **Seeds to plant:** The bandit problem may connect to larger regional instability. Voss is a symptom, not the disease.

### Arc 3: The Price of Legend (Levels 7-10)
- Tamwin faces threats that challenge his survival and morality.
- Theme: What are you willing to sacrifice? Your safety? Your principles? Your soul?
- Endpoint: Tamwin becomes the kind of legend bards sing about---or the kind they whisper warnings of.
